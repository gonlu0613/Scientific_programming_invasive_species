# Predicting ecological impact of invasive species using machine learning and ecological traits
Repository for my project in **Scientific Programming** (MSB1015). One part of the course is to learn how to maintain version control using tools like git. This part of the README has now been written on my Positron locally, for this project I will use python as a programming languages as it has extensive libraries for machine learning and data exploration.
The data for this project can be found on data dryad:

The dataset needed is called "assess.txt".
